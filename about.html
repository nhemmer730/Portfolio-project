                                Hi, I am Nicole Hemmer
                            </h1>

                            <p class="mb-5">I had left my job as a teacher of Students with Visual Impairments for
                                11 years when I found the SheCodes workshops. I loved teaching technology to my students
                                and had always been curious about coding. I started the Basics course and was amazed at
                                how much I
                                learned in those first
                                three weeks. The information was
                                organized and I loved that I could review the videos to help when doing the challenges.
                                At the end of the
                                workshop, I had created my first ever
                                landing page. I was hooked!
                                After completing three more workshops, I have created many different pages, using HTML,
                                Javascript, CSS as well as
                                incorporating Bootstrap and APIs. I love playing with the layout and design making
                                something that looks and works well.
